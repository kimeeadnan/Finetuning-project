Where is the Air Force Engineering Development Center located?,"At the Air Force Engineering Development Center of the United States of America at Arnold Airbase, Tennessee, two research teams recently participated in the NASA next-generation manned exploration vehicle experiment. A team used conventional and advanced measurement techniques in the aerodynamic experiments of the new NASA Orion model. Orion will be used to send future space probes to other planets of the solar system. The spacecraft is scheduled to conduct manned flights no later than 2014. The objective of the test was to obtain surface heat data for the model at 8 and 10 hours of the free gas current mach. Unlike the development of the Apollo spacecraft, which fully uses test data, the Orion database obtained data using advanced computational hydrodynamic techniques. The test data will be used to verify computational hydrodynamic data. The high-macht and high-pressure environmental conditions in Fountain 9 will enable NASA aircraft to obtain relevant data. Another team supported the Orion project at the final stage of the project by promoting the use of temperature-sensitive paint.","Arnold Airbase, Tennessee",Tennessee

What was Samourai designed for?,"Samourai was designed by Samourai in collaboration with Serat Engineering to shoot a variety of 76.2 mm grenades in narrow spaces, indoors, and shoulder-fired rooms. The typical shoulder-fired assault weapon requires a small back seat, which limits the size and accuracy of the bomb. Samourai used a unique buffer system, which was extended from 3 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds, reducing the back seating capacity to an acceptable level, without mechanical vibrations or noise. Samourai, with a minimum safety distance of only 60 centimetres on the back and up, was able to fire directly from the tunnels, the subway, the sewers, and the enclosed rooms.

What did L-3 Communications demonstrate at the 2005 joint meeting of the American Army Association?,"At the 2005 joint meeting of the American Army Association, held in October, L-3 Communications demonstrated an improved N/GSR-8REMBASS-II unmanned ground sensor system - a remote target identification system designed to capture and relay images. L-3 Communications is currently competing for a contract with the United States Central Command, which is scheduled to be officially released in late 2005, to provide static imaging capabilities in the form of unmanned ground sensors. REM-VIEW is an integrated imaging and unmanned ground sensor system that detects, classifies and determines the direction of people and vehicles in a passive manner, and provides high-resolution imagery of the site being detected. Image and sensor data are then followed by a field processing unit through a satellite communication system to a remote operation centre.
